Channels
FIFO

select statement
The select statement lets a goroutine wait on multiple communication operations.
A select blocks until one of its cases can run, then it executes that case. It chooses one at random if multiple are ready.

## 3 concurrency patterns
-- for-select loop
-- done channel
-- pipelines

make channel without specific capacity  is unbuffered channel,that synchronize goroutine sender and receiver
bufferedChannel will not block goroutine sender until channel is full max

pipeline
start -> thing 1(do something) -> thins 2 (do something)
    (data)                     (data)
